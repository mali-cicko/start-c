Objective: Make lil' cicko best programmer ever!

- Learn algorithms, analysis of algorithms and co through c. 
- Learn data structures.
- Develop right mindset related to programming, with leaning on math.

- Implement everything as we progress. 


- Learn to use (and about) Git, CMake, Refactoring, Clean Code and co.

- Learn how to debug and track bugs and errors.



So far: 

Cicko is recalling very good what she learned before. Accepting new stuff
with ease. So far we cover some general knowledge computer science and
started with coding. So far she coded basic stuff to run/test sorting algorithms
also she wrote basic mechanism to measure time. This is great for analysis of
algorithms as we progress through Skiena. 

Next:

Talk about algorithm analysis and cover related Skienas exercises.
Learn about refactoring and technical aspects of programming.
	- Change code to look better (increase maintability)
	- Refactor/enhance functions
	- Write comments. 

Learn about CMake and Git. Basic stuff for starters.
